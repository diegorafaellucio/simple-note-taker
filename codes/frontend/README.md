   - Smooth transitions and loading states

### Design Patterns & Best Practices

1. **State Management**
   - Local state with React hooks for component-level state
   - Custom hooks for shared state logic
   - Proper state initialization and cleanup

2. **Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error boundaries
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Graceful fallbacks

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Debounced API calls
   - Efficient re-rendering with proper dependency management
   - Lazy loading of components when appropriate

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
