hello this is the demo for a note taking app for everyone who wants to keep track of their notes in an organized and aesthetic way so when the user first logs in into the app they see a sign of screen where they can enter their email and their password they can also toggle between viewing and not viewing the password that they're typing and they can sign up if they've already created their account they can click and be taken to the login page where they can enter their email and password and login instead in this case let me pretend like I have never created an account before and then that case I will land on an empty State because there are no notes I will see the categories that are automatically creative for me the categories are random thoughts school and personal and I will see the option to create a new note so that is the beginning of the journey now users should be able to create new notes by clicking on the new note icon the structure of a note is there is the space to create the note the note is automatically created as soon as the user clicks on new note there is no need to save it or anything like that it is automatically created the note also has the last edited timestamp which updates the note has a title and the content of the note finally the note also has a category and the user can decide to change that I have to change the category the color of the background color of the note will change to the color associated to that category when one has finished typing they can close the note and they will be taken back to the screen where all of the notes are so this is what this screen is it has again the categories on the left each of the categories displays the color associated with the category the title and then the number of notes Associated to that category and again the category is done exists a random thoughts school and personal we automatically create these if the user were to select any of these categories by clicking on them it will filter and show them only the notes that are associated to that category if they click on all categories they'll be able to see all of the notes know how the notes are displayed are there displayed in preview cards the preview card contains the date of the last at a time as well as the category name the title of the content of the content does not fit in the preview card then the content is truncated like in this card over here on the right Leslie I must say that the date should be displayed as month and day no year should be displayed and if the notice from today or from yesterday we should use the relative dates today and yesterday any day that is older than yesterday it should just display month and date finally users should be able to edit existing notes so for example if I click on the note it will open it and I will be able to see the content of the note but I will always be able to edited by clicking on the text I can edit both the title and the content of the note as soon as I added the last and it is stamps should be automatically updating and the other thing I can edit is the category by clicking on on the category in the drop-down I can also at the category and that's it that is the note taking up
